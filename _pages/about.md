I am a research associate at the [Lamarr Institute](https://lamarr-institute.org/) for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, located at TU Dortmund University.
Currently, I am doing my PhD in quantum computing, where I mainly work with combinatorial optimization problems, how they can be solved on quantum annealers, and their applications for machine learning.
I am also particularly interested in non-gradient-based optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms;
as part of my master's thesis, I implemented a quantum-inspired QUBO solver on an FPGA, which has since been patented.

In addition to my scientific activities, I am a passionate musician:
For almost 20 years I have been a member in several choirs and vocal ensembles, currently in [Bach-Chor Hagen](https://www.bach-chor-hagen.de), the [Chamber Choir of TU Dortmund](https://kammerchor.tu-dortmund.de/), the [Bochum Provost Chamber Choir](https://www.propsteimusik-bochum.de/) and the soloist ensemble [Vokal Ruhr](https://www.facebook.com/people/Vokal-Ruhr/100064304944070/).
My voice type is tenor.
I also perform as a soloist. In addition, I occasionally compose my own music.
In 2022, some of my pieces were [published](https://klangraum-kirche.de/news/rezension-nova-ex-antiquis-butz-verlag-3050-15-e/) in a collection of contemporary organ music.
Some recordings of my compositions can be found on my YouTube channel and on this website.
